      <description>After my first attempt at making a RSS feed aggregator, I began to feel discouraged. The data that I hoped would be there was disorganized and I felt like every workaround would lead me to a new problem. I took some time away from the code, and I came back with a new approach.
This time, instead of trying to make an aggregator, I decided to instead focus my attention to 3 smaller problems.</description>

      <description>This post is related to my previous post about civic code. I mentioned that there are multiple RSS feeds that the city maintains, and that this data is not particularly easy to find and parse.
We are going to create an RSS feed aggregator creates a weekly summary and automatically creates a new post on this blog. For now, we&amp;rsquo;ll just use the City of Windsor Open Data Catalogue, but we&amp;rsquo;ll probably add more feeds in a future iteration.</description>
