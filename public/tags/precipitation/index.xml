      <description>After my first attempt at making a RSS feed aggregator, I began to feel discouraged. The data that I hoped would be there was disorganized and I felt like every workaround would lead me to a new problem. I took some time away from the code, and I came back with a new approach.
This time, instead of trying to make an aggregator, I decided to instead focus my attention to 3 smaller problems.</description>
