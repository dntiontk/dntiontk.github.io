      <description>When I started working on the civic-code project, I was annoyed at the lack of accessibility when it came to accessing City Council meeting documents and videos.
The meeting index is not well organized either. You have to open up a menu just to see what documents (agenda, minutes, video link, appendices, etc.) have been added to a particular meeting.
Considering that this is still an issue, I decided that I would try to create a more structure index of the documents.</description>
