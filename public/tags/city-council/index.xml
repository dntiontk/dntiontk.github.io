      <description>When I started working on the civic-code project, I was annoyed at the lack of accessibility when it came to accessing City Council meeting documents and videos.
The meeting index is not well organized either. You have to open up a menu just to see what documents (agenda, minutes, video link, appendices, etc.) have been added to a particular meeting.
Considering that this is still an issue, I decided that I would try to create a more structure index of the documents.</description>

      <description>I frequently find myself on the City of Windsor website. I&amp;rsquo;ll scroll through city council meeting agendas and videos, browse the open data catalogue, check for newsroom headlines; annoyed by how outdated it feels the entire time. This isn&amp;rsquo;t about the look of the site either. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the asthetics. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about it feeling like the site is intentionally disjointed and built in a way to make engagement a little bit harder.</description>
