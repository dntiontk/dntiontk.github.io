      <description>When I started working on the civic-code project, I was annoyed at the lack of accessibility when it came to accessing City Council meeting documents and videos.
The meeting index is not well organized either. You have to open up a menu just to see what documents (agenda, minutes, video link, appendices, etc.) have been added to a particular meeting.
Considering that this is still an issue, I decided that I would try to create a more structure index of the documents.</description>

      <description>After my first attempt at making a RSS feed aggregator, I began to feel discouraged. The data that I hoped would be there was disorganized and I felt like every workaround would lead me to a new problem. I took some time away from the code, and I came back with a new approach.
This time, instead of trying to make an aggregator, I decided to instead focus my attention to 3 smaller problems.</description>

      <description>This post is related to my previous post about civic code. I mentioned that there are multiple RSS feeds that the city maintains, and that this data is not particularly easy to find and parse.
We are going to create an RSS feed aggregator creates a weekly summary and automatically creates a new post on this blog. For now, we&amp;rsquo;ll just use the City of Windsor Open Data Catalogue, but we&amp;rsquo;ll probably add more feeds in a future iteration.</description>

      <description>I frequently find myself on the City of Windsor website. I&amp;rsquo;ll scroll through city council meeting agendas and videos, browse the open data catalogue, check for newsroom headlines; annoyed by how outdated it feels the entire time. This isn&amp;rsquo;t about the look of the site either. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the asthetics. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about it feeling like the site is intentionally disjointed and built in a way to make engagement a little bit harder.</description>
