        <p>I&rsquo;m a Black software developer based in Windsor, Ontario, and I&rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.</p>
<p>As a DevOps/Platform Engineer, I&rsquo;m all about automation and making things run smoothly. I&rsquo;ve worked with a ton of different technologies over the years, but I&rsquo;m especially into Kubernetes and all the cool things you can do with it.</p>
<p>In my work, I&rsquo;ve tackled a bunch of different challenges, from scaling to security to performance. It&rsquo;s definitely been a journey, but I&rsquo;m always up for a new challenge.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I&rsquo;m usually either drumming or hanging out with my kids. I&rsquo;m also super political and believe in using my voice to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all about creating an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone who wants to learn and grow. If you&rsquo;re into coding or tech, or just looking to connect with some like-minded folks, you&rsquo;re in the right place.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by and checking out my blog. I&rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you!</p>
