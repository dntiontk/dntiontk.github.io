As part of my [civic-code adventures]({{< ref "/posts/civic-code.md" >}}), I've put together a Google Calendar for the City of Windsor Council Meeting schedule for 2025. The city does [publish an annual calendar](https://citywindsor.ca/documents/city-hall/city-council-meetings/Council%202025/2025MeetingSchedule.pdf), which I've ported over and made available below. The meeting start times are available in the event descriptions, and the table below shows the general times.

| Meeting                                                        | Time    |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| Community Services Standing Committee                          | 9:00am  |
| Regular Council Meeting                                        | 10:00am |
| Development & Heritage Standing Committee                      | 4:30pm  |
