I'm a Black software developer based in Windsor, Ontario, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

As a DevOps/Platform Engineer, I'm all about automation and making things run smoothly. I've worked with a ton of different technologies over the years, but I'm especially into Kubernetes and all the cool things you can do with it.

In my work, I've tackled a bunch of different challenges, from scaling to security to performance. It's definitely been a journey, but I'm always up for a new challenge.

When I'm not working, I'm usually either drumming or hanging out with my kids. I'm also super political and believe in using my voice to make the world a better place.

I'm all about creating an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone who wants to learn and grow. If you're into coding or tech, or just looking to connect with some like-minded folks, you're in the right place.

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you!
